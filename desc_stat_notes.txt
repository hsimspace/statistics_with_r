* It is divided into: descriptive and inferential statistics.

* Descriptive statistics:
	- Summarize, describe and characterize the sample.

	- Determine if the sample is normally distributed (bell curve).

	- Determine if the sample can be compared to the larger population.

	- Are displayed as tables, charts, percentage, frequency 
	  distributions, and as measures of central tendency.

* Central tendency:
	- Mean
	
	- Median
	
	- Mode
	

* Measures of variability:
	- Range: difference between the largest and smallest number.
	
	- Variance: how far the numbers are spread out. 
	
	- Standard deviation: how much variation exists from the mean.

* Skewness: how symmetrical the distribution of variable is.
