#Find the range of the sets
#4.1
x4_1a <- c(12, 6, 7, 3, 15, 10, 18, 5)
x4_1b <- c(9, 3, 8, 8, 9, 8, 9, 18)

max(x4_1a) - min(x4_1a)
max(x4_1b) - min(x4_1b)

#4.2 - Range from table2.1
# Range = class mark highest class - class mark of lowest class
#class mark is the midle value of a class
#... to do later
